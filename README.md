# Airport Simulator

I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of an Airport Simulator project, a dynamic and interactive application designed to simulate airport operations. The project leveraged a diverse set of technologies and methodologies to create a realistic and engaging user experience.

Key Technologies:

**ASP.NET Core API**: The backend was built using ASP.NET Core, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the application's logic.
**ASP.NET Core MVC**: The frontend utilized ASP.NET Core MVC for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
**SignalR**: Real-time communication was achieved through SignalR, enabling seamless updates and interactions between different components of the simulator.
**SQL Database**: The project incorporated a SQL database to persistently store and manage data, contributing to the realism of the simulation.
**Semaphore**: Semaphore was employed for effective asynchronous operations, enhancing the overall performance of the application.
**C#**: The project was predominantly developed in C#, leveraging its strong object-oriented programming capabilities.
Notable Features:

**Real-time Updates**: SignalR facilitated real-time updates, allowing users to experience dynamic changes in the airport environment.
**Concurrency Management**: The use of Semaphore and C# ensured effective concurrency management, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of the simulator.
**User Interaction**: The application provided an interactive interface for users to control and monitor various aspects of airport operations.
Challenges and Achievements:

**Concurrency Challenges**: Managing concurrent operations in a dynamic simulation environment presented challenges, which were effectively addressed using Semaphore and thoughtful design.
Realism: The integration of real-time updates, SQL database, and user interactions contributed to the realism of the simulator, enhancing the user experience.
This project reflects my proficiency in full-stack development, real-time communication, and effective concurrency management. It showcases my ability to create engaging and dynamic applications using modern web technologies.
